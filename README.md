# What is Bicep?
Bicep is a Domain Specific Language for deploying Azure resources and the goal is to simplify the coding experience with cleaner syntax, intellisense, and better support for code re-use. [The Bicep Playground](https://azure.github.io/bicep/) is a great tool that compares Bicep code side by side with JSON code. This can help you understand the syntax and ease the learning curve for beginners.
